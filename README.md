## Sample Network Reference Architecture6
This repository contains the code that can be used to provision a VNET in Azure
* via Infrastructure-as-Code
* according to a common deployment pattern

The common pattern will go as following ;
* Typically use a /16 network (f.e. 10.40.0.0/16) as the address space for the VNET
* Use the last /24 range (f.e. 10.40.254.0/16) for the Gateway & DMZ subnets
* Provide the ability to rollout subnets in the unused space before the DMZ ranges (f.e. 10.40.0.0 - 10.40.253.254)
* It will follow a common naming pattern like "SUBNETxxx" for the regular subnets and "SUBNETDMZ" for the ones from DMZ. The gatway subnet will use the mandatory "GatewaySubnet" as name"

The template files also have an accompanying .tests file that can be picked up by pester for unit/integration testing. The tests will include some basic unit testing and will do several test deployments as a kind of smoke test /syntax validation.

You can find exports of the Build & Release definitions under the [VSTS](/VSTS) folder in this repository. The release definition can be imported with out-of-the-box VSTS functionality. For the build definition, you'll need to use the following extension ; [Export/Import Build Definition](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=onlyutkarsh.ExportImportBuildDefinition)

## Tasmanian Traders
Tasmanian Traders is a [fictional Microsoft company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_Microsoft_companies) which I found to be a very cool name. It makes me think back towards the Tasmanian Devil in Looney Tunes. Here I've "borrowed" the name as a kind of theme for all demos related to Azure.
